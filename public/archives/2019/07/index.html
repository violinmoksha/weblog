<p>PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress with custom theme and plugins I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009. This was based on the design assets of a static website my friend had designed by GoDaddy, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme and wrote a few custom plugins. F.e. it integrates with MailChimp API. This site is maybe not too relevant to my tech experiences in backend, but I reference it here as demo of my commitment to frontend craftsmanship and making the web work empathically for real people functioning as cottage-industries–using plain ol’ PHP/Mysql/Wordpress.</p>

<p>ArubaNetworks.com is a WordPress with an enterprise HAProxy infrastructure. While contracting for SolutionFuse I fully-wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config resulting from lengthy RRTE with the Aruba IT team. Configuring and deploying the new Ruleset saved the company millions of dollars as many layers of the IT team’s hours-long manual deployment ops were no longer necessary per production-release.</p>

<p>Smartie was more or less an R&amp;D stealth-startup for a hybrid-mobile full application stack I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet deployed to production but it is sitting in my github awaiting VC attention at some future-date. It utilizes MEAN (Mongo/Express/Angular/Node) with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained -then-adopted open source originating out of Facebook’s retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction-layer). ParseJS had a nice dashboard for skinning as a customer-service interface furthermore, thus not only did it serve as a reasonable API response-serving -replacement for ExpressJS but also made for a good two-fer as-such. Smartie has Angular-based Ionic Framework in the front, mostly chosen over React for its SCSS kitchen sink. Ionic also came with great pre-wrapped test-bed using karma-jasmine and protractor.</p>
<p>As UX, Smartie is an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&amp;D motto while working for SolutionFuse). The app results in real-life scheduling and AI-facilitated interactions by-conception, offering a way for knowledge-transmission and education to happen in a formal way (yet outside-academia). You can observe my offshore junior demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (deployed cross-platform on iOS and Droid thanks to Ionic Framework’s inclusion of Apache Cordova). This demo’s the student and teacher connecting with each other initially through the application, and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">shown here</a>. For interested Angels or VC’s who might want to help our Smartie startup out of its dusty stealth-basement and back into the light of day, I have copies of all five of its codebases under my IP rights AFAIK.</p>
<p>I’m humbly-proud of the work I’m displaying here as it most-completely manifests all my skills tied together in a single project, from scratch (and hopefully someday to finish as a design-baby not yet fully-matured). It needs a new funding container for its work to be continued, so feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:humbl3@protonmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humbl3@protonmail.com</a>. This is your project to fund if you’re interested in seeing education (think martial arts, massage therapy, non-western classical musics) sprout a newly-formalized life outside more-traditional institutes of knowledge.</p>

<p>Mitel is a company which bought Shoretel, a prior enterprise-client. Their current partner-finder is a redo of what was originally a Salesforce (“SOQL”) API-integrating NodeJS/ExpressJS middleware I authored and maintained (called from AJAX from the partner finder [AJAX-out], talked to Salesforce via SOQL on the back [SOQL-in]). The Partner Finder “middleware” also cached the data via heroku Scheduler, into a MongoDB cluster hosted in mLab. This middleware’s ExpressJS-powered endpoints were availed to Shoretel’s frontend partner-finder integration, utilizing CORS so as to make our Express routes available to AJAX from an existing enterprise-Drupal’s calls from the Partner Finder’s frontend. UI/feature-wise, the exact-same Partner Finder is presumably still in production use at Mitel, using the same basic architectural approach -apprised.</p>

<p>My first major exposure to Full Stack work in MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) was begun as POC/prototyping R&amp;D in my Bank of America days (2010-2014), when our team noticed NodeJS gaining traction and stability. Thus my first full stack work was there in ~2013-2014. I later went to work for HotelQuickly in Bangkok while living in Thailand where I first used AngularJS (“version 1”, not yet v2/Typescript), and then the SolutionFuse consulting-firm in the US while still-residing in Thailand. The hybrid-mobile app I built HotelQuickly hasn’t stuck around in production as the company went under, but the hybrid-mobile app for SANE Forums I authored soon-after has; it’s still in production today and can be downloaded from stores for iOS/Android. For this application based out of Australia, I took an already mobile-responsive website my consulting-firm SolutionFuse had built using the Lithium web framework, and built for it a vanilla- Apache Cordova “Javascript shell” to live in devices as IPA for iOS and APK for Android. This way, the existing website could be easily-housed within device-specific mobile-apps since the Responsive UX already had the CSS media calls needed for mobile-render. The shell gracefully maintains the state of the existing sessions-authentication from the Lithium-website furthermore, using existing cookies and hashes. This primitive-shell was basically just native-encapsulated DOM injection with a number of inter-communicating interval-polls. The Cordova build consumes a small footprint of well-configured native-plugins, so as to transform the mobile-responsive site directly into a mobile app for a variety of screen sizes and cross-platform. This was one of my earliest pushes to production in the hybrid-mobile space as it utilizes “plain vanilla” web code, and doesn’t really need to make use of any frontend JS frameworks or libraries within its render (such as Angular or even jQuery), save cordova plugins. Nothing fancy under the hood, but it elegantly-achieved a Ferrari-appearance to the client as the end-result was a fully-functioning mobile app in iOS and Android!</p>

<p>I authored and integrated the “Account Transaction Module” UI in 2010-2012, still running in production today in Bank of America Checking/Savings (Deposits) and perhaps also still on corporate credit card pages. The integration is comprised of several Perforce-maintained components I also later supported. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then are still executing in the transactions search panel that millions of eComm consumers continue to use today. The entire jQuery DataTables integration visually-beneath that–with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table–are also still attached to the same JS algorithms I utilized at the time, such that complex table sorts do not require browser-reloads from the server.</p>
<p>If you see acronym-named JS bundles running in the outer View Source of the page, PIPAD is the application acronym used for the Deposits-related application which later came to own my UI code. These components were standalone at first and well-documented as artifacts in the UI team’s Perforce repository. Then, they were rewritten to accommodate tighter-knit J2EE application-ownership following a corporate re-org. The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface today, whereby if you have a BofA checking account you might see certain transactions that want to give you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone –&gt; get a deal at AutoZone on your next trip to AutoZone. This was coded to be triple-A (“AAA”) ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging, keyboard-navigation indeces, and other means of complying with the highest level of accessibility guidelines. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business which you may have noticed as a customer through the glass teller window; we built a web integration for that such that customers can see their check images inside the expandable transaction-panels inside the transactions table.</p>

<p>Old Kentucky Chocolates, I first wired this site’s eCommerce using Perl CGI and mSQL (not MySQL but mSQL, which was still around at the time) in ~1999-2000 inside an Apache vhosts configs. I had never coded before and was working just out of high school for Web-Point Communications in Rocky Mount, North Carolina at the time. We can see from Wappalyzer that thankfully they’ve upgraded their server architecture and technology stack-choices quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now (more like what I’d most-commonly use today if there were an Apache web server in the picture). (And also of course everyone using mSQL started using MySQL later, due to portability, security patches, wider array of Linux cross-platform, etc. In those days, mSQL was still all the rave.) This was the beginning of my career in web development. Having an online eCommerce storefront on the web to complement one’s physical brick-and-mortar store was a brand-new concept, and so Kentucky-chocolate was a likely retail product-seller to get on the “www” for eCommerce in its infant-years. This was the first time I used a server-language like Perl CGI furthermore, to both talk to a database in the back and render the HTML on the front. As such, the project proves that full stack isn’t actually a very new concept. PHP wasn’t really a thing yet, so Perl was the tool of choice as a backend web programming language.</p>
