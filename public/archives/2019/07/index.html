        <p>PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009, and probably in need of security updates or custom patches, but I’ll leave that up to WordPress core. (I should probably pen-test this from my Kali Linux VM sometime.) In any case, this was based on the design assets of a static website my friend has had designed by GoDaddy originally I believe, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme and wrote a custom module or two. It integrates with MailChimp API, still with no breaking deprecations (or at least, as far as I know). (This site is not too relevant to my tech experiences in full-stack I realize, but I post reference to it here as demo of my commitment to craftsmanship and making the web work empathically for real human people–even in frameworks like those built of PHP which I may at times not prefer–but I do it for the love of the craft.)</p>

        <p>ArubaNetworks.com (as is public info), is a WordPress with a server infra. Due to the unnamed infra+WordPress configurability constraints, at SolutionFuse I wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config in Akamai to cache all assets and refine asset caching mechanisms according to RRTE (Reverse Round-trip Eng) feedback from a team of Aruba’s developers. Configuring its caching ruleset eliminated many of the company’s IT team’s layers of what were proven to be ultimately unnecessary manual operations which were having to be done to roll out releases by manually purging caches themselves. These operations removed during launch-times, this made their release-time activities much less laborious.</p>

        <p>Smartie is a hybrid-mobile app I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet in production but is a massive hybrid-mobile full-stack app nonetheless, utilizing MEAN with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained open source originating out of Facebook’s retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction+dashboard layer) and Ionic Framework in front of the Angular 2+ Typescript (for its nice SCSS kitchen sink and reasonably easy OOP framework integration in general). It’s an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&amp;D motto), resulting in real-life app-facilitated interactions. You can observe the offshore lead of my juniors demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (iOS and Droid), connecting with each other and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">all right here</a>. I have copies of all five of its codebases, for any potential funders of the half-born R&amp;D idea going forward. I’m most proud of the work I’m displaying here as it most-completely manifests my skills in full-stack, but it needs a new funding container for its work to be continued.

        <p>Mitel is a company which bought Shoretel, another enterprise-client. Their current partner-finder is a redo of what was originally a Salesforce (“SOQL”) API-integrating NodeJS+ExpressJS middleware I authored and maintained. Mitel wanted a redo in their non-Javascript stacks. Thus, in any case, the “Partner Finder” which got the redo took data from Salesforce via SOQL calls, and cached the data on a heroku Scheduler into a MongoDB at mLab. Then, this middleware’s ExpressJS-powered endpoints were availed to Shoretel’s frontend partner-finder integration utilizing CORS config on the backend and AJAX from an existing Drupal’s calls on the front. What is—UI feature-wise—the exact same partner-finder is still in production use at mitel.com albeit utilizing different frameworks than its original (M)EAN’ish middleware arch. I helped Mitel (who acquired Shoretel) reintegrate their new frameworks so as to do the same as ours had for Shoretel, via very thoroughly technically documenting the integration front-to-back in our firm’s gitlab README, and doing a few remote Knowledge Transfers with the new Mitel team, ultimately.</p>

        <p>My first major exposure to Full Stack work (i.e. MEAN stack) was begun as POC/prototyping R&amp;D bank in my Bank of America days (2010-2014), when we noticed NodeJS gaining traction and stability, thus my first full stack work was there in ~2013-2014. However, I later went to work for HotelQuickly in Bangkok and then SolutionFuse while still-residing in Thailand but working in the US remotely, where actual pro production-deployed full stack work (and/or several NodeJS middleware architectures utilizing Express and various APIs) were deployed. Unfortunately, the hybrid-mobile app I built HotelQuickly hasn’t stuck around in production today apparently, but for example, the hybrid-mobile app SANE Forums, a mental health organization in Australia which SolutionFuse took on early in my time there, is still in production and maintained as the same app as far as I know, today. For this, at SolutionFuse I took an already mobile-responsive website built using the Lithium framework, and built for it an Apache Cordova “shell” for, so as to house the same sessions authentication from the SANE website within our manually-built Cordova JS shell, deployable as IPA or APK in iOS and Android. (See <a href="/images/saneforums.png">the screenshot</a> for desktop website and same web code loading inside the mobile app. The shell is basically just native-encapsualted JS DOM injection via a well-configured Cordova plugin so as to transform the mobile-responsive site directly into a mobile app.)</p>

        <p>I authored and integrated UI initially in 2010-2012, running in production today in Bank of America Checking/Savings (Deposits) and presumably also still on credit card transaction listing pages. There are several (what were) Perforce-maintained components I authored which we can see in the Bank of America Checking/Savings interfaces today. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then are probably still responsible to date for doing the frontend validation for the search panel we see there. The entire jQuery Datatables integration beneath that, with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table are also probably still attached to my JS algorithms (probably still the same simple quicksort remains for sorting without a page reload). This fairly heavy module used to be called olb-transaction-journal-module , and was later renamed account-transaction-module. Also the entire page is wired to what I recall was AA-level ADA compliance, meaning teams of non-sighted users would run tests on the interface using their JAWS interface for the blind. Thus furthermore, the entire UI must integrate very well with the keyboard as the user’s primary means of navigation.</p>
<p>If you see “PIPAD” -named JS bundles running in the outer view source of the page, this was the acronym used for the Deposits-related application which this UI integrates with, utilizing FTL (FreeMarker Template Language) as template layer with its Struts or Spring integrations. The UI components are of course standalone and were coded as docs-referenced artifacts in the UI codebase, first. The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface, whereby if you have a BofA checking you might see certain transactions that want to give you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone, get a deal at AutoZone in the future. This too was coded to be fully ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business, from which we built an integration ultimately to deliver the images of a person’s checks directly into check transactions. I can demonstrate that as well if we like, but any BofA account holder is still using the production feature mentioned here last, no doubt maintained to date…</p>

We can see from Wappalyzer—-thankfully of course—-they’ve upgraded their server arch and stack quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now. (And also of course, everyone using mSQL started using MySQL instead due to portability, security patches, etc. but mSQL was my first exposure to SQL, then.)</p>

        <p>Welcome to <a href="http://paulyeager.net">Paul Yeager’s Web Development Portfolio</a>! This is my web portfolio site. The portfolio’s NodeJS hexo-cli -generated server code I have also open sourced @ <a href="https://github.com/violinmoksha/weblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. You too can have yet another website in under an hour or so (plus however long it takes you to type your markdown content). ;-p</p>
<p>On this site I document some of the mainstays of the current web which were built and/or were maintained by me, Paul Yeager. I may also mention–with ethical redaction–how various unnamed infrastructures were changed or improved through my professional interactions with said unnamed infra–amidst descriptions of my work–of course without any specific reference to any company or person aside from myself. This is so as to of course ethically protect our markets’ continued growth-utilizing functions or methods I contributed to in current production(s). This way, I’m able to exercise best practices in ethical client confidentiality and corporate propriety, while also being able to give you the reader more insights into understanding what I do and what makes me tick.</p>
<p>The ways in which I have chosen to contribute to the growth and functionality of the world wide web are ways which I can empathically deem to be ethically good for human beings, simply-stated. Whether it’s working closely with accessibility users being able to do their online corporate banking more easily through their JAWS interface, adding a new layer of crypto to a medical application creating better security for private data storage, or diagnosing intermittent data capture lapses in the load balancer of a highly-distributive private fire protection hybrid-mobile app across multiple residential neighborhoods or urban manufacturing, I strive to live and breathe critical enterprise web infrastructures in my professional engineering activities.</p>
<p>I’m also a classical violinist by the way, with 30+ years experience learning and playing the violin in an often-professional context. I was a world-touring child prodigy, and am recorded on multiple CDs still available on Amazon. As other semi-professional hobbies, I learn human languages surprisingly rapidly, through an ecstatic love of being able to branch off my neuroplastic pre-conditioning into new ways of interacting with humans. That in turn has an impact in my cognitive command of delivering obsessively high-quality code and contributes to my ability to notice and modify microscopic detail. Ethical hacking and penetration testing for example, are a lingual realm, and so I stay neurologically well-rounded lingually for this and many other reasons. I’ve at different times deeply-studied German and Thai, my Hindi and French less-so. I lived abroad for three total years, and I’ve transited or toured through ~two dozen countries in three continents, as well as been involved in multiple international projects. I bring a cosmopolitan perspective on work ethics and company cultures. Three cheers to our peace and cooperation as a post-technological species, and humbly-proudly: for the love of my country’s web as well! After all, “Engineers build America.” :-) &lt;3</p>
