<p>PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress with custom theme and plugins I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009. This was based on the design assets of a static website my friend had designed by GoDaddy, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme and wrote a custom module or two. It integrates with MailChimp API, still with no breaking deprecations. This site is maybe not too relevant to my tech experiences in backend, but I reference it here as demo of my commitment to craftsmanship and making the web work empathically for real people–using plain old PHP/Mysql/Wordpress.</p>

<p>ArubaNetworks.com is a WordPress with an enterprise HAProxy infrastructure. While contracting for SolutionFuse I fully-wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config, following lengthy RRTE with the Aruba IT team. Configuring and deploying the new Ruleset saved the company millions of dollars as many layers of the IT team’s hours-long manual deployment ops were no longer necessary per production-release.</p>

<p>Smartie was more or less a stealth-startup for a hybrid-mobile full application stack I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet deployed to production but it is sitting in my github awaiting VC attention at some future-date. It utilizes MEAN with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained -then-adopted open source originating out of Facebook’s retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction layer). ParseJS had a nice dashboard for skinning as a customer-service interface, thus not only did it serve as a nice API routing replacement for ExpressJS but also made for a nice two-fer in this regard. Smartie has Angular-based Ionic Framework in the front, for an SCSS kitchen sink that we found superior to Material UI, and Ionic came with nice pre-wrapped automated test capabilities using karma-jasmine and protractor.</p>
<p>As UX, Smartie is an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&amp;D motto while working for SolutionFuse). The app results in real-life scheduling and AI-facilitated interactions by-conception, offering a way for knowledge-transmission and education to happen in a formal way, yet outside-academia. You can observe my offshore junior demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (deployed cross-platform on iOS and Droid thanks to Ionic Framework which came with Apache Cordova pre-wrapped). This demo’s the student and teacher connecting with each other initially through the application, and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">all right here</a>. For interested Angels or VC’s who might want to help our Smartie startup out of stealth and into the light of SV startup-culture, I have copies of all five of its codebases under my IP rights AFAIK.</p>
<p>I’m humbly-proud of the work I’m displaying here as it most-completely manifests all my skills tied together in a single project, from scratch (and hopefully someday to completion as my design-baby not yet “all grown up”). It needs a new funding container for its work to be continued, so feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:humbl3@protonmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humbl3@protonmail.com</a> if you’re interested in seeing education sprout a new life outside universities and more-formal institutions-of-knowledge.</p>

<p>Mitel is a company which bought Shoretel, a prior enterprise-client. Their current partner-finder is a redo of what was originally a Salesforce (“SOQL”) API-integrating NodeJS/ExpressJS middleware I authored and maintained (called from AJAX from the partner finder [AJAX-out], talked to Salesforce via SOQL on the back [SOQL-in]). The Partner Finder middleware also cached the data via heroku Scheduler, into a MongoDB cluster stored in mLab. This middleware’s ExpressJS-powered endpoints were availed to Shoretel’s frontend partner-finder integration, utilizing NodeJS CORS config on the backend so as to make our Express routes available to AJAX from an existing Drupal’s calls from the Partner Finder’s frontend. UI/feature-wise, the exact-same Partner Finder is still in production use at Mitel, using the same basic architectural approach.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/saneforums.png" alt="SANE Forums, Australia"></p>
<p>My first major exposure to Full Stack work in MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) was begun as POC/prototyping R&amp;D in my Bank of America days (2010-2014), when our team noticed NodeJS gaining traction and stability, thus my first full stack work was there in ~2013-2014. However, I later went to work for HotelQuickly in Bangkok while living in Thailand, and then the SolutionFuse consulting-form in the US, while still-residing in Thailand. The hybrid-mobile app I built HotelQuickly hasn’t stuck around in production as the company went under, but the hybrid-mobile app for SANE Forums I authored soon-after, is still in production today and can be downloaded from stores for iOS/Android. For this application based out of Australia, I took an already mobile-responsive website my consulting-firm SolutionFuse had built using the Lithium web framework, and built for it a vanilla- Apache Cordova “Javascript shell” to live in devices as IPA (iOS)/APK (Android). This way, the existing website could be easily housed within a mobile-app since the Responsive UX already had the CSS media calls needed for mobile-render. The shell gracefully maintains the state of the existing sessions-authentication from the existing Lithium-website furthermore, using existing cookies and hashes. The JS shell is basically just native-encapsulated DOM injection with a number of inter-communicating timed-polls. The Cordova build consumes a small footprint of well-configured native-plugins, so as to transform the mobile-responsive site directly into a mobile app for a variety of screen sizes and cross-platform. This was one of my earliest pushes to production in the hybrid-mobile space as it utilizes “plain vanilla” web code, and doesn’t really need to make use of any JS frameworks or libraries within its Cordova built, such as Angular (or even jQuery for that matter). Nothing fancy under the hood, but looked like a Ferrari to the client as the end-result was a fully-functioning cross-platform mobile app!</p>

<p>I authored and integrated the “Account Transaction Module” UI in 2010-2012, still running in production today in Bank of America Checking/Savings (Deposits) and perhaps also still on corporate credit card pages. The integration is comprised of several Perforce-maintained components I initially-authored and later supported. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then are still responsible to-date for the frontend validations in the search panel which millions of eComm consumers continue to use today. The entire jQuery DataTables integration beneath that, with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table are also still attached to the same simple data algorithms I wrote at the time, such that complex table sorts do not require a page reload from the server.</p>
<p>If you see acronym-named JS bundles running in the outer view source of the page, PIPAD is the application acronym used for the Deposits-related application which later came to own my UI code. These components were standalone at first but and well-documented as artifacts in the UI team’s Perforce repository and then rewritten to accommodate tighter-knit J2EE application-ownership following a corporate re-org. The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface lately, whereby if you have a BofA checking you might see certain transactions that want to give you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone –&gt; get a deal at AutoZone in the future. This was coded to be triple-AAA ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging and keyboard-navigation indeces. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business which you may have noticed as a customer through the glass teller window, from which we built a web integration for such that customers can see their check images inside the expandable AJAX-driven transaction-panels.</p>

<p>Old Kentucky Chocolates, I first wired this site’s eCommerce using Perl CGI and mSQL (not MySQL but mSQL, which was still around at the time) in ~1999-2000 inside an Apache vhosts configs. I had never coded before and was working just out of high school for Web-Point Communications in Rocky Mount, North Carolina at the time. We can see from Wappalyzer–thankfully–they’ve upgraded their server architecture and technology stack-choices quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now, like I would use today if I were running anything off of an Apache. (And also of course, everyone using mSQL started using MySQL instead due to portability, security patches, Linux cross-platform, etc., but in those days mSQL was all the rave.) This was the beginning of my career in web development. Having an online eCommerce storefront on the web to complement one’s physical brick-and-mortar store was a brand-new concept, and so Kentucky-chocolate was a likely product to get on the “www” in its infant-years. This was the first time I used a web language like Perl CGI furthermore, to both talk to a database in the back and render the HTML on the front, so the project proves that full stack isn’t actually a very new concept. PHP wasn’t really a thing yet, so Perl was the tool of choice as a web language.</p>
