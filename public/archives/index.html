<p>PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009, and probably in need of security updates or custom patches, but I’ll leave that up to WordPress core. (I should probably pen-test this from my Kali Linux VM sometime.) In any case, this was based on the design assets of a static website my friend had designed by GoDaddy, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme and wrote a custom module or two. It integrates with MailChimp API, still with no breaking deprecations (or at least, as far as I know). (This site is maybe not too relevant to my tech experiences in backend, but I reference it here as demo of my commitment to craftsmanship and making the web work empathically for real people–even in frameworks like those built of PHP which I may at times not prefer.)</p>

<p>ArubaNetworks.com (as is public info), is a WordPress with a server infra. Due to the unnamed infra+WordPress configurability constraints, at SolutionFuse I fully-wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config in Akamai, following lengthy RRTE with dev team. Configuring this eliminated many of the company’s IT team’s layers of what were proven to be ultimately unnecessary hours-long manual operations.</p>

<p>Smartie is a hybrid-mobile app I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet in production but is a massive hybrid-mobile full-stack app nonetheless, utilizing MEAN with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained -then-adopted open source originating out of Facebook’s retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction layer, which had a nice dashboard for skinning). It has Angular-based Ionic Framework in the front, for its nice SCSS kitchen sink as well as for its automated test capabilities. Smartie an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&amp;D motto), resulting in real-life app-facilitated interactions. You can observe the offshore lead of my juniors demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (iOS and Droid), connecting with each other and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">all right here</a>. Thus I have copies of all five of Smartie’s codebases for any potential VC funders of the more-than half-born R&amp;D idea going forward.</p>
<p>I’m humbly-proud of the work I’m displaying here as it most-completely manifests all my skills tied together in a single project. It needs a new funding container for its work to be continued.

<p>Mitel is a company which bought Shoretel, a prior enterprise-client. Their current partner-finder is a redo of what was originally a Salesforce (“SOQL”) API-integrating NodeJS+ExpressJS middleware I authored and maintained. Mitel wanted a redo in their non-Javascript stacks. Thus, in any case, the “Partner Finder” which got the redo took data from Salesforce via SOQL calls, and cached the data on a heroku Scheduler into a MongoDB at mLab. Then, this middleware’s ExpressJS-powered endpoints were availed to Shoretel’s frontend partner-finder integration utilizing CORS config on the backend and AJAX from an existing Drupal’s calls on the front. What is UI/feature-wise the exact-same partner-finder, is still in production use at mitel.com albeit utilizing different frameworks than its original (M)EAN’ish middleware arch. I helped Mitel (who acquired Shoretel) reintegrate their new frameworks (so as to do the same as ours had for Shoretel), via very thoroughly technically documenting the integration front-to-back in our firm’s gitlab README. I also did many KTs direct to the acquiring company, so they’d be running with our basic tech design…</p>

<p>My first major exposure to Full Stack work (i.e. MEAN stack) was begun as POC/prototyping R&amp;D bank in my Bank of America days (2010-2014), when we noticed NodeJS gaining traction and stability, thus my first full stack work was there in ~2013-2014. However, I later went to work for HotelQuickly in Bangkok and then SolutionFuse in the US, while still-residing in Thailand. Unfortunately, the hybrid-mobile app I built HotelQuickly hasn’t stuck around in production today, but the hybrid-mobile app SANE Forums–a mental health organization in Australia which SolutionFuse took on early in my time there–is still in production and maintained as the same app afaik, today. For this, at SolutionFuse I took an already mobile-responsive website built using the Lithium framework, and built for it an Apache Cordova “shell” to live in devices’ IPA/APK, so as to house the same sessions authentication from the SANE website within our manually-built shell app. (See <a href="/images/saneforums.png">the screenshot</a> for desktop website and same web code loading inside the mobile app. The shell is basically just native-encapsulated JS DOM injection via a set of well-configured Cordova plugins, so as to transform the mobile-responsive site directly into a mobile app. One might think of this app as “plain vanilla” hybrid-mobile, therefore, since its only “web” framework is Cordova).</p>

<p>I authored and integrated UI initially in 2010-2012, still running in production today in Bank of America Checking/Savings (Deposits) and perhaps also still on credit card transaction listing pages. There are several (what were) Perforce-maintained components I authored which we can see in the Bank of America Checking/Savings interfaces today. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then are likely still responsible to date for doing the frontend validation for the search panel we see there. The entire jQuery Datatables integration beneath that, with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table are more likely-definitively still attached to my JS algorithms (and perhaps still the same simple quicksort remains for sorting without page reload).</p>
<p>If you see acronym-named JS bundles running in the outer view source of the page, this may have been the acronym used for the Deposits-related application which this UI integrates with. My-authored UI components were of course standalone and were coded as docs-referenced artifacts in the UI codebase. The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface lately, whereby if you have a BofA checking you might see certain transactions that want to give you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone, get a deal at AutoZone in the future. This was coded to be ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business which you may have noticed as a customer through the glass teller window, from which we built an integration ultimately to deliver the images of a person’s checks more directly into your web interface. I can demonstrate that as well if we like, but any BofA account holder is still using many of the production features mentioned here, likely maintained to date.<sup>†</sup></p>
<p><sup>†</sup>Note for corporate enterprises regarding security vs. obfuscation (pls see: UNIX and Internet Security, ORA publishing please): for a living reference to my work, one can open browser view source to see all of that to which I definitively refer, whereas anything I have referred to as hyperbole is simply hyperbole. Browser code is of course viewable by the non-technical user, and probably always will be. Of course, please consider kindness as virtue prior to any innovation thereupon, as the world is generally composed of equal-parts: secrecy -and- transparency. 8-)</p>

<p>Old Kentucky Chocolates, I first wired this site’s eCommerce using Perl CGI and mSQL in ~1999-2000 inside a Apache virtual hosts confs working just out of high school for Web-Point Communications (first Endorsement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/humbl3/" target="_blank">on my LinkedIn</a> to this day was my first boss there). We can see from Wappalyzer—-thankfully of course—-they’ve upgraded their server arch and stack quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now. (And also of course, everyone using mSQL started using MySQL instead due to portability, security patches, etc. but mSQL was my first exposure to SQL, then.)</p>
