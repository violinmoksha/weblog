Smartie was more or less a stealth-startup for a hybrid-mobile full application stack I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet deployed to production but it is sitting in my github awaiting VC attention at some future-date. It utilizes MEAN with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained -then-adopted open source originating out of Facebook's retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction layer). ParseJS had a nice dashboard for skinning as a customer-service interface, thus not only did it serve as a nice API routing replacement for ExpressJS but also made for a nice two-fer in this regard. Smartie has Angular-based Ionic Framework in the front, for an SCSS kitchen sink that we found superior to Material UI, and Ionic came with nice pre-wrapped automated test capabilities using karma-jasmine and protractor.

As UX, Smartie is an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&D motto while working for SolutionFuse). The app results in real-life scheduling and AI-facilitated interactions by-conception, offering a way for knowledge-transmission and education to happen in a formal way, yet outside-academia. You can observe my offshore junior demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (deployed cross-platform on iOS and Droid thanks to Ionic Framework which came with Apache Cordova pre-wrapped). This demo's the student and teacher connecting with each other initially through the application, and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">all right here</a>. For interested Angels or VC's who might want to help our Smartie startup out of stealth and into the light of SV startup-culture, I have copies of all five of its codebases under my IP rights AFAIK.

I'm humbly-proud of the work I'm displaying here as it most-completely manifests all my skills tied together in a single project, from scratch (and hopefully someday to completion as my design-baby not yet "all grown up"). It needs a new funding container for its work to be continued, so feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:humbl3@protonmail.com">humbl3@protonmail.com</a> if you're interested in seeing education sprout a new life outside universities and more-formal institutions-of-knowledge.
