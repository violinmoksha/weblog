Smartie was more or less an R&D stealth-startup for a hybrid-mobile full application stack I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet deployed to production but it is sitting in my github awaiting VC attention at some future-date. It utilizes MEAN (Mongo/Express/Angular/Node) with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained -then-adopted open source originating out of Facebook's retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction-layer). ParseJS had a nice dashboard for skinning as a customer-service interface furthermore, thus not only did it serve as a reasonable API response-serving -replacement for ExpressJS but also made for a good two-fer as-such. Smartie has Angular-based Ionic Framework in the front, mostly chosen over React for its SCSS kitchen sink. Ionic also came with great pre-wrapped test-bed using karma-jasmine and protractor.

As UX, Smartie is an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&D motto while working for SolutionFuse). The app results in real-life scheduling and AI-facilitated interactions by-conception, offering a way for knowledge-transmission and education to happen in a formal way (yet outside-academia). You can observe my offshore junior demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (deployed cross-platform on iOS and Droid thanks to Ionic Framework's inclusion of Apache Cordova). This demo's the student and teacher connecting with each other initially through the application, and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">shown here</a>. For interested Angels or VC's who might want to help our Smartie startup out of its dusty stealth-basement and back into the light of day, I have copies of all five of its codebases under my IP rights AFAIK.

I'm humbly-proud of the work I'm displaying here as it most-completely manifests all my skills tied together in a single project, from scratch (and hopefully someday to finish as a design-baby not yet fully-matured). It needs a new funding container for its work to be continued, so feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:humbl3@protonmail.com">humbl3@protonmail.com</a>. This is your project to fund if you're interested in seeing education (think martial arts, massage therapy, non-western classical musics) sprout a newly-formalized life outside more-traditional institutes of knowledge.
