Smartie is a hybrid-mobile app I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet in production but is a massive hybrid-mobile full-stack app nonetheless, utilizing MEAN with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained open source originating out of Facebook's retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction+dashboard layer) and Ionic Framework in front of the Angular 2+ Typescript (for its nice SCSS kitchen sink and reasonably easy OOP framework integration in general). It’s an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&D motto), resulting in real-life app-facilitated interactions. You can observe the offshore lead of my juniors demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (iOS and Droid), connecting with each other and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">all right here</a>. I have copies of all five of its codebases, for any potential funders of the half-born R&D idea going forward. I'm most proud of the work I'm displaying here as it most-completely manifests my skills in full-stack, but it needs a new funding container for its work to be continued.
