Smartie is a hybrid-mobile app I and my juniors designed, authored, and maintained while I was at SolutionFuse. It is not yet in production but is a massive hybrid-mobile full-stack app nonetheless, utilizing MEAN with a ParseJS layer in the back (from community-maintained -then-adopted open source originating out of Facebook's retirement of the formerly-named cloud-hosted Mongo abstraction layer, which had a nice dashboard for skinning). It has Angular-based Ionic Framework in the front, for its nice SCSS kitchen sink as well as for its automated test capabilities. Smartie an educational app for connecting teachers to students (a “lyft for knowledge” as per our R&D motto), resulting in real-life app-facilitated interactions. You can observe the offshore lead of my juniors demonstrating a full UX flow, with a teacher profile in one platform and a student profile in another (iOS and Droid), connecting with each other and proceeding to the Point of Sale, <a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/5d7487960/r3rwihv4-gzu3zdz3-bq94v36c-37ya42m3" target="_blank">all right here</a>. Thus I have copies of all five of Smartie's codebases for any potential VC funders of the more-than half-born R&D idea going forward.

I'm humbly-proud of the work I'm displaying here as it most-completely manifests all my skills tied together in a single project. It needs a new funding container for its work to be continued. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:humbl3@protonmail.com">humbl3@protonmail.com</a>.
