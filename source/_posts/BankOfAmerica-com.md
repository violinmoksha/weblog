I authored and integrated the "Account Transaction Module" UI in 2010-2012, still running in production today, in Bank of America's Checking/Savings ("Deposits") pages, and likely also still on Corporate Credit. The integration is comprised of several artifactually-maintained module-components I also later supported, the bulk of which is the transactions module mentioned. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then, are usually still running today in the transactions search panel of the Online Banking production browser-experience that millions of customers continue to rely on today, 24x7. The jQuery DataTables integration tying it all together--with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table--are (like I said, usually--or at least, so long as any rookie Java devs are in fact, having their cuppa java) are still there, such that complex transactions Sorts do not require browser-reloads from the server-side J2EE page-reloaded application-instance.

If you see "PIPAD" acronym-named JS bundles running in the View Source of the page, that's said Java j2e application runtime, probably still-deployed for the Deposits-related UIs, which came to own my UI code after a corporate re-org, which had left several Java applications-teams owning the prior UI Teams' code, scattered across their Java apps' code-lands. These UI components were standalone at first, and centrally-managed by said UI Team I worked for in 2010-2012, thus were well-documented and centrally-maintained as artifacts in the UI Team's source repositories. Then, they were rewritten to accommodate tighter-knit J2EE application-ownership, following said corporate re-org, which'd even allowed me to go on sabbatical at some point, after which I was rehired by the app that owned my code. 

The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface today, whereby if you have/had a BofA checking, you might see certain transactions that want to hand you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone --> get a deal at AutoZone on your next trip there. This was coded to be triple-A ("AAA") ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging, keyboard-navigation by JS, and other means of complying with the highest standards of web accessibility/wcag guidelines. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business, which you may have noticed as a customer through the glass teller window; we built a web integration for that, such that customers can see their check images inside the expandable transaction-panels inside the transactions HTML table, thus providing a more-continuous customer-experience--starting at the teller window, gracefully providing continuity right into the banking customer's Online Banking browsing-experience. We were the best at web, and IMO we still are. 🇺🇸
