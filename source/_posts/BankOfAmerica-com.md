I authored and integrated UI initially in 2010-2012, running in production today in Bank of America Checking/Savings (Deposits) and presumably also still on credit card transaction listing pages. There are several (what were) Perforce-maintained components I authored which we can see in the Bank of America Checking/Savings interfaces today. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then are probably still responsible to date for doing the frontend validation for the search panel we see there. The entire jQuery Datatables integration beneath that, with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table are also probably still attached to my JS algorithms (probably still the same simple quicksort remains for sorting without a page reload). This fairly heavy module used to be called olb-transaction-journal-module , and was later renamed account-transaction-module. Also the entire page is wired to what I recall was AA-level ADA compliance, meaning teams of non-sighted users would run tests on the interface using their JAWS interface for the blind and visually-impaired. Thus furthermore, the entire UI must integrate very well with the keyboard as the user's primary means of navigation.

If you see “PIPAD” -named JS bundles running in the outer view source of the page, this was the acronym used for the Deposits-related application which this UI integrates with, utilizing FTL (FreeMarker Template Language) as template layer with its Struts or Spring integrations. The UI components are of course standalone and were coded as docs-referenced artifacts in the UI codebase, first. The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface, whereby if you have a BofA checking you might see certain transactions that want to give you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone, get a deal at AutoZone in the future. This too was coded to be fully ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business, from which we built an integration ultimately to deliver the images of a person’s checks directly into check transactions. I can demonstrate that as well if we like, but any BofA account holder is still using the production feature mentioned here last, no doubt maintained to date...
