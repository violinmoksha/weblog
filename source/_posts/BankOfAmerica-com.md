I authored and integrated the "Account Transaction Module" UI in 2010-2012, still running in production today, in Bank of America's Checking/Savings ("Deposits") pages, and likely also still on Corporate Credit. The integration is comprised of several artifactually-maintained module-components I also later supported, the bulk of which is the transactions module mentioned. The regexes doing the frontend search validation in JS I wrote then, are usually still running today in the transactions search panel of the Online Banking production browser-experience that millions of customers continue to rely on today, 24x7. The jQuery DataTables integration tying it all together--with its Sort and Filter controls running in the thead of the table--are (like I said, usually, when rookie Java devs don't mess up the regular production app redeployments, occasionally mistakenly thinking these sorts should be server-side, when the algos were authored to run more-virtuosically, instantly, from clicks in the browser UI) are still there, such that complex transactions Sorts do not require browser-reloads from the server-side J2E app.

If you see "PIPAD" acronym-named JS bundles running in the View Source of the page, that's the Java j2e application runtime probably still deployed for the Deposits-related UIs, which came to own my UI code after a corporate re-org, which left several Java applications-teams owning the prior UI Teams' code, scattered across several Java applications. These UI components were standalone at first, and centrally-managed by the UI Team I worked for in 2010-2012, thus were well-documented and centrally-maintained as artifacts in the UI team's source repositories. Then, they were rewritten to accommodate tighter-knit J2EE application-ownership following the corporate re-org, which ultimately'd allowed me to go on a sabbatical, after which I was rehired by the app that owned my code. 

The fly-out “deals” integration was another project still-evident in the production interface today, whereby if you have/had a BofA checking account, you might see certain transactions that want to give you a “deal”, f.e. buy a part at AutoZone --> get a deal at AutoZone on your next trip to AutoZone. This was coded to be triple-A ("AAA") ADA-compliant, using i.e. ARIA tagging, keyboard-navigation indeces, and other means of complying with the highest standards of web accessibility guidelines. There’s also a check-scanner at the teller’s place of business which you may have noticed as a customer through the glass teller window; we built a web integration for that such that customers can see their check images inside the expandable transaction-panels inside the transactions table, thus providing a more-continuous customer-experience starting at the teller window, and gracefully completing in the banking customer's browser UI Online Banking user-experience. We were the best at web, and IMO we still are. 🇺🇸
