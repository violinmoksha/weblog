My first major exposure to Full Stack work in MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) I'd delved into as POC/prototyping R&D in my Bank of America days (2010-2014), when our Team'd noticed NodeJS gaining traction-and -stability in the wider tech community. Thus my first "full stack" work was there ~2013-2014. However, I'd later gone to work for an Eastern European -operated company in Bangkok, while living in Thailand, where I'd first used AngularJS ("version 1", not yet v2/Typescript), then utilizing Angular for the SolutionFuse consulting-firm I began contracting for in the US. The hybrid-mobile app I built for said, since-redacted company from Eastern Europe, hasn’t stuck around in production, while the hybrid-mobile app for SANE Forums I authored, soon-after remained; it's still in production sometime after, AFAIK, and can be downloaded from stores for iOS/Android, or elsewhere. For this application based out of AU, I took an already mobile-responsive website my consulting-firm SolutionFuse had built using the Lithium web framework, and built for it a "vanilla" Apache Cordova “Javascript shell” to live in devices as IPA for iOS, and APK for Android. This way the existing website could be easily-housed within device-specific mobile-apps, since the site was already Responsively-coded for render on mobile/tablet. The "shell" gracefully maintains the state of the existing sessions-authentication from the Lithium-website, using existing cookies and hashes. This primitive-shell was basically just native-encapsulated DOM injection with a number of inter-communicating interval-polls--it's a "Kitty Hawk" for modern, hybrid-mobile apps. (Apache's Cordova of course, later became Capacitor, which is what React, Next, and other SPA developers tend to think of as the "go to" for encapsulating web code in IPA/SPK.) The Cordova build consumes a small footprint of well-configured native-plugins, so as to transform the mobile-responsive site directly into a mobile app, for a variety of screen sizes and cross-platform. This was one of my earliest pushes to production in the hybrid-mobile space as it utilizes "plain vanilla" web code, while also doesn't need to make use of any frontend JS frameworks or libraries within its render yet (such as NG, or even jQuery for that matter). Nothing fancy under the hood, but it elegantly-achieved a Porsche-delivery, as the end-result was a lean, crash-free, fully-functioning Mobile App in iOS and Android!
