My first major exposure to Full Stack work in MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) was begun as POC/prototyping R&D in my Bank of America days (2010-2014), when our team noticed NodeJS gaining traction and stability. Thus my first full stack work was there in ~2013-2014. I later went to work for HotelQuickly in Bangkok while living in Thailand where I first used AngularJS ("version 1", not yet v2/Typescript), and then the SolutionFuse consulting-firm in the US while still-residing in Thailand. The hybrid-mobile app I built HotelQuickly hasn’t stuck around in production as the company went under, but the hybrid-mobile app for SANE Forums I authored soon-after has; it's still in production today and can be downloaded from stores for iOS/Android. For this application based out of Australia, I took an already mobile-responsive website my consulting-firm SolutionFuse had built using the Lithium web framework, and built for it a vanilla- Apache Cordova “Javascript shell” to live in devices as IPA for iOS and APK for Android. This way, the existing website could be easily-housed within device-specific mobile-apps since the Responsive UX already had the CSS media calls needed for mobile-render. The shell gracefully maintains the state of the existing sessions-authentication from the Lithium-website furthermore, using existing cookies and hashes. This primitive-shell was basically just native-encapsulated DOM injection with a number of inter-communicating interval-polls. The Cordova build consumes a small footprint of well-configured native-plugins, so as to transform the mobile-responsive site directly into a mobile app for a variety of screen sizes and cross-platform. This was one of my earliest pushes to production in the hybrid-mobile space as it utilizes "plain vanilla" web code, and doesn't really need to make use of any frontend JS frameworks or libraries within its render (such as Angular or even jQuery), save cordova plugins. Nothing fancy under the hood, but it elegantly-achieved a Ferrari-appearance to the client as the end-result was a fully-functioning mobile app in iOS and Android!
