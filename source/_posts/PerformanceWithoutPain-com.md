PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009, and probably in need of security updates or custom patches, but I'll leave that up to WordPress core. (I should probably pen-test this from my Kali Linux VM sometime.) In any case, this was based on the design assets of a static website my friend had designed by GoDaddy, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme and wrote a custom module or two. It integrates with MailChimp API, still with no breaking deprecations (or at least, as far as I know). (This site is maybe not too relevant to my tech experiences in backend, but I reference it here as demo of my commitment to craftsmanship and making the web work empathically for real people--even in frameworks like those built of PHP which I may at times not prefer.)
