PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress with custom theme and plugins I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009. This was based on the design assets of a static website my friend had designed by GoDaddy, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme and wrote a custom module or two. It integrates with MailChimp API, still with no breaking deprecations. This site is maybe not too relevant to my tech experiences in backend, but I reference it here as demo of my commitment to craftsmanship and making the web work empathically for real people--using plain old PHP/Mysql/Wordpress.
