PerformanceWithoutPain.com is a WordPress with custom theme and plugins I built for a nutritionist friend, which is still in production since ~2009. This was based on the design assets of a static website my friend had designed by GoDaddy, so I took down the site and made her a custom wordpress theme, and wrote a few custom plugins. For example, it integrates with MailChimp API, and did so in MC's first few MAJOR semvers. This site is maybe not too relevant to my experiences in backend, but I reference it here as demo of my commitment to frontend craftsmanship, and making the web work empathically for real people and their cottage-industries, using plain ol' PHP/MySQL/Wordpress ("LAMP").
