Old Kentucky Chocolates, I first wired this site’s eCommerce using Perl CGI and mSQL (not MySQL but mSQL, which was still around at the time) in ~1999-2000 inside an Apache vhosts configs. I had never coded before and was working just out of high school for Web-Point Communications in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, at the time. We can see from the browser View Source that thankfully they’ve upgraded their server architecture and technology stack-choices quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now (more like what I'd most-commonly use today if there were an Apache still in the picture). (And also of course everyone using mSQL started using MySQL later, due to portability, security patches, wider array of Linux cross-platform, open source, and other advantages which to the devs of today are generally more obvious than mSQL. It was 1999, it was all the rave.) Without intending to date myself: this was the beginning of my career in webdev, Old Kentucky Candy at Web-Point Communications, under a kind ol' gentlemanly USAF Vet who'd taken me under his wing, fresh out of high school. Having an online eCommerce storefront on the web to complement one's physical brick-and-mortar store was a brand-new concept, and so Kentucky-chocolate was an "early adopter" retail product-seller, so-as to get on the "Superhighway" for Internet eCommerce in its early years. This was also the first time I used a server-language like Perl CGI, to both talk to a database in the backend, and render the HTML into the user's web browser on the front. As such, IMO the project proves "full stack" isn't actually very new. PHP wasn't really a thing yet, so Perl was the tool of choice as backend web programming language, and I had my trusty O'Reilly -published *printed book* (imagine that, a printed book), for understanding how to program using PERL. ("Practical Extraction and Report Language".)
