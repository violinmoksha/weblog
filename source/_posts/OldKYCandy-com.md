Old Kentucky Chocolates, I first wired this site’s eCommerce using Perl CGI and mSQL in ~1999-2000 inside a Apache virtual hosts confs working just out of high school for Web-Point Communications (first Endorsement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/humbl3/" target="_blank">on my LinkedIn</a> to this day was my first boss there). We can see from Wappalyzer—-thankfully of course—-they’ve upgraded their server arch and stack quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now. (And also of course, everyone using mSQL started using MySQL instead due to portability, security patches, etc. but mSQL was my first exposure to SQL, then.)
