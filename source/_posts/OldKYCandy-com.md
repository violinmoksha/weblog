Old Kentucky Chocolates, I first wired this site’s eCommerce using Perl CGI and mSQL (not MySQL but mSQL, which was still around at the time) in ~1999-2000 inside an Apache vhosts configs. I had never coded before and was working just out of high school for Web-Point Communications in Rocky Mount, North Carolina at the time. We can see from Wappalyzer--thankfully--they’ve upgraded their server architecture and technology stack-choices quite a bit since then, with an nginx reverse proxy in front of whatever is there now, like I would use today if I were running anything off of an Apache. (And also of course, everyone using mSQL started using MySQL instead due to portability, security patches, Linux cross-platform, etc., but in those days mSQL was all the rave.) This was the beginning of my career in web development. Having an online eCommerce storefront on the web to complement one's physical brick-and-mortar store was a brand-new concept, and so Kentucky-chocolate was a likely product to get on the "www" in its infant-years. This was the first time I used a web language like Perl CGI furthermore, to both talk to a database in the back and render the HTML on the front, so the project proves that full stack isn't actually a very new concept. PHP wasn't really a thing yet, so Perl was the tool of choice as a web language.
