ArubaNetworks is/was a WordPress with an enterprise AWS ElasticBeanstalk HAProxy infra. While contracting for SolutionFuse, I fully-wired their infra to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config resulting from lengthy RRTE orchestrated amidst the Aruba, Akamai, and AWS tech support teams and their multiple vested interests. Configuring and deploying the new Ruleset saved our client Aruba millions of dollars, as many layers of their IT team's hours-long manual deployment ops proved no longer necessary per production-release thereafter. This is probably the most-proprietary DevOps'ian sort of stuff I've done on C2C, as I'm aware Aruba held U.S. government contracts. Though not GSC myself, this project made for an exciting complexity of highly-technical interactions between multiple corporate interests, as I had to navigate being able to deliver value-punching results, while maintaining the professional acumen that was expected of myself and our SolutionFuse team.
