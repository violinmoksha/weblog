ArubaNetworks.com (as is public info), is a WordPress with a server infra. Due to the unnamed infra+WordPress configurability constraints, at SolutionFuse I fully-wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config in Akamai, following lengthy RRTE with dev team. Configuring this eliminated many of the company’s IT team’s layers of what were proven to be ultimately unnecessary hours-long manual operations.
