ArubaNetworks.com (as is public info), is a WordPress with a server infra. Due to the unnamed infra+WordPress configurability constraints, at SolutionFuse I wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config in Akamai to cache all assets and refine asset caching mechanisms according to RRTE (Reverse Round-trip Eng) feedback from a team of Aruba's developers. Configuring its caching ruleset eliminated many of the company’s IT team’s layers of what were proven to be ultimately unnecessary manual operations which were having to be done to roll out releases by manually purging caches themselves. These operations removed during launch-times, this made their release-time activities much less laborious.
