ArubaNetworks is/was a WordPress with an enterprise AWS ElasticBeanstalk HAProxy infra. While contracting for SolutionFuse, I fully-wired their infra to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config resulting from lengthy RRTE, orchestrated amidst the Aruba, Akamai, and AWS tech support teams and their multiple vested interests. This required coordinated, highly-detailed engineering-comms across several continents and their timezones. And, configuring and deploying the new Ruleset saved our client Aruba millions of dollars as a result, as many layers of their IT team's hours-long manual-deployment ops proved no longer necessary thereafter, per every production-release. This was probably the most-proprietary DevOps'ic sort of stuff I've done on "cop to cop", as I'm aware Aruba held U.S. govt contracts. Though not GSC myself, the project made for an exciting complexity of highly-tech interactions between multiple concerned interests, as I had to navigate being able to deliver value-adding results, while maintaining the pro acumen that was expected of myself and our SolutionFuse team.
