ArubaNetworks.com is a WordPress with an enterprise HAProxy infrastructure. While contracting for SolutionFuse I fully-wired their site to Akamai CDN, using a well-refined Ruleset config, following lengthy RRTE with the Aruba IT team. Configuring and deploying the new Ruleset saved the company millions of dollars as many layers of the IT team's hours-long manual deployment ops were no longer necessary per production-release.
